       "'Page: Elon Musk\\nSummary: Elon Reeve Musk ( EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is a businessman known for his leadership of Tesla, SpaceX, X (formerly Twitter) and DOGE. Musk has been considered the wealthiest person in the world since 2021; as of May 2025, Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$424.7 billion. \\nBorn to a wealthy family in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk emigrated in 1989 to Canada. He received bachelor\\'s degrees from the University of Pennsylvania in 1997 before moving to California, United States, to pursue business ventures. In 1995, Musk co-founded the software company Zip2. Following its sale in 1999, he co-founded X.com, an online payment company that later merged to form PayPal, which was acquired by eBay in 2002. That year, Musk also became a American citizen.\\nIn 2002, Musk founded the space technology company SpaceX, becoming its CEO and chief engineer; the company has since led innovations in reusable rockets and commercial spaceflight. Musk joined the automaker Tesla as an early investor in 2004 and became its CEO and product architect in 2008; it has since become a leader in electric vehicles. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI to advance artificial intelligence research but later left; growing discontent with the organization\\'s direction and their leadership in the AI boom in the 2020s led him to establish xAI. In 2022, he acquired the social network Twitter, implementing significant changes and rebranding it as X in 2023. His other businesses include the neurotechnology company Neuralink, which he co-founded in 2016, and the tunneling company the Boring Company, which he founded in 2017. He was named Time magazine\\'s Person of the Year in 2021.\\nMusk\\'s political activities and views have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation and promoting conspiracy theories, and affirming antisemitic, racist, and transphobic comments. His acquisition of Twitter was controversial due to a subsequent increase in hate speech and the spread of misinformation on the service. Especially since the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Musk has been heavily involved in politics as a vocal supporter of Trump. Musk was the largest donor in the 2024 U.S. presidential election and is a supporter of global far-right figures, causes, and political parties. In early 2025, he served as senior advisor to United States president Donald Trump and as the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). His role in the second Trump administration, particularly in response to DOGE, has attracted public backlash.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Elon Musk salute controversy\\nSummary: On January 20, 2025, while speaking at a rally celebrating U.S. president Donald Trump\\'s second inauguration, businessman and political figure Elon Musk twice made a salute interpreted by many as a Nazi or a fascist Roman salute.\\nIt was widely condemned as an intentional Nazi salute in Germany, where making such gestures is illegal. The Anti-Defamation League said it was not a Nazi salute, but other Jewish organizations disagreed and condemned the salute. American public opinion was divided on partisan lines as to whether it was a fascist salute. Musk dismissed the accusations of Nazi sympathies, deriding them as \"dirty tricks\" and a \"tired\" attack. Neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups celebrated it as a Nazi salute. Multiple European political parties demanded that Musk be banned from entering their countries.\\n\\nPage: Wealth of Elon Musk\\nSummary: Elon Musk is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$381 billion as of May 2025, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $424.7 billion according to Forbes, primarily from his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX. \\nHaving been first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, around 75% of Musk\\'s wealth was derived from Tesla stock in November 2020. Describing himself as \"cash poor\", he became the fir'"
